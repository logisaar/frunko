# TODO: Implement Product Details Dialog for Featured Items

## Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Import Dialog components from shadcn/ui in Home.tsx
- [ ] Add state variables for selectedItem (FoodItem | null) and dialogOpen (boolean)
- [ ] Make each item Card clickable to open the dialog (set selectedItem and dialogOpen)
- [ ] Modify the Add to Cart button on the card to prevent event bubbling
- [ ] Add the Dialog component after the grid with proper content (image, name, description, price, badge, Add to Cart button)
- [ ] Test the dialog functionality and image sizing
